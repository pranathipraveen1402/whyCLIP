                    Despite one image being from the trailer and the other from the movie, 
                    their traditional feature graphs appear nearly identical. This similarity suggests that the lighting, 
                    brightness, and color variance remain largely unchanged between the two. The only noticable change is 
                    that the hue mean is closer to 0 (Dominant tint is Red)

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Monotone Tones: Traditional features miss fine-grained variations, making different contexts look similar.</li>
                    <li>Lack of Robustness: They fail to capture trailer-specific color grading or visual shifts.</li>
                    <li>Poor Contextual Representation: They ignore narrative elements and scene significance.</li>
